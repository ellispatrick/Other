Pretty sure an ad like that would be illegal in NZ. 

 

Would a transgender person be considered?  i.e. is the applicant
required to have breasts, or must the applicant not have a penis?

It looks like it is very likely illegal in NZ under HRA 1993 and ERA
2000 to put out a similar ad in NZ.\
However my understanding is it could be legal in NZ to discriminate on
grounds of misogyny - unless one could show that is basically the same
as discriminating on one of the grounds covered explicitly by these
acts.\
So Steve, I guess you could still be ruled out (irrespective of
biological equipment) if a NZ uni wanted to use affirmative action in
some way to recruit from the same under-represented group?\

In Victoria section 12 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 has an
exemption:\
A person may take a special measure for the purpose of promoting or
realising substantive equality for members of a group with a particular
attribute.\
\
The examples provided are\
1. A company operates in an industry in which Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islanders are under-represented. The company develops a training
program to increase employment opportunities in the company for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\
2 A swimming pool that is located in an area with a significant Muslim
population holds women-only swimming sessions to enable Muslim women who
cannot swim in mixed company to use the pool.\
3 A person establishes a counselling service to provide counselling for
gay men and lesbians who are victims of family violence, and whose needs
are not met by general family violence counselling services.

Largely they seemed sensible exceptions  (and as a general principle, I

This all boils down to opinions on affirmative action. I know some
people have issues with it, but in the fight against centuries of
ingrained inequality it is at worst a necessary evil.

The question about gender identity is a separate one, and an argument
could be made that the advertisement fails to consider gender-neutral
and gender-diverse people. However, one would hope that "female
applicants" would be interpreted as "applicants who identify as female".

G’day, Everyone.\

Even if we have equal opportunity legislation that makes it illegal to
discriminate against people on certain grounds, it’s pretty clear, I
think, positive discrimination is necessary to ensure equal opportunity
in some cases - and gender is a clear-cut case.\

The ad indicates that the positions are advertised "pursuant to a
Special Measure under Section 12 (1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010
(Vic)". I'm not a lawyer, but on skimming the relevant law, it looks as
if the ad is compliant; the point of 12(1) is to promote substantive
equality, e.g. for a field where members of a particular group are
underrepresented due to systemic inequalities.\

(with exemptions for religious organisations not relevant to this

Dear all,

As a staff member (and an ex-Head) in the School of Mathematics and
Statistics at the University of Melbourne, I'm perfectly prepared to
speak up in support of this.

The rationale and the legal justification for advertising the positions
as women-only is explained in the advertisement itself:

\`The University plan seeks to increase the diversity of the workforce
and the representation of women in areas they have been traditionally
under-represented. Consistent with this, the School of Mathematics and
Statistics is seeking to increase the representation of women in the
academic workforce across mathematical disciplines. Pursuant to a
Special Measure under Section 12 (1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010
(Vic), the School is seeking to lift the representation of women and
therefore will only consider applications from suitably qualified female
candidates for these three positions.'

For a whole range of reasons, the School is not as effective as it would
be if it had a better gender balance across its academic staff. The
usual first measures, such as requiring gender balance on appointment
committees and trying to get gender balance in shortlists haven't
worked. But the School is serious about tackling this issue, which has
led to the advertised positions. 

A mailing list such as ANZstat is not the place for a detailed debate
about affirmative action, - I'd be happy to have that face-to-face if
anyone is in town - but members can be assured that these measures were
not taken lightly and were taken for the right reasons.

Best wishes,

Peter

We are getting ourselves tied in knots because the categories that 

have been traditionally used in Western society do not fit the demands 

of a society that has started to attend to the issues of those that are
not

accommodated, or are not well accommodated, by those traditional

categories.  There are no easy answers.

Reading Rebecca Stott’s “Darwin’s Ghosts”, I have been struck by the

extent to which most of those who were in some sense (mostly a very

weak sense) Darwin’s predecessors were oddballs in the Greek or

Islamic or Christian societies in which they lived.  The sorts of
troubles

that they experienced are not totally beyond the realms of experience

of modern scientists, but they are generally much less severe.  A few

individuals get highly lauded and honoured.  The intellectual realm

has proved much easier to deal with than the realm of physical and

emotional being.

On the face of it, some non-Western societies may have done a much 

better job of addressing such issues.  Samoa and the Samoan diaspora

have acknowledge the Fa'afafine as a third-gender people.

Presumably they are specifying ‘female applicants only’ as a way of
trying to increase the number of females applying for the job. But I
wonder if this will actually have the desired effect?

As a female, I’d personally feel uncomfortable applying for a position
that was for female applicants only. I’d be worried that if I did land
the job my colleagues would look down on me as only having got the job
because no males were allowed to apply.

Statistics, female applicants only

 

Dear all,

As a staff member (and an ex-Head) in the School of Mathematics and
Statistics at the University of Melbourne, I'm perfectly prepared to
speak up in support of this.

The rationale and the legal justification for advertising the positions
as women-only is explained in the advertisement itself:

\`The University plan seeks to increase the diversity of the workforce
and the representation of women in areas they have been traditionally
under-represented. Consistent with this, the School of Mathematics and
Statistics is seeking to increase the representation of women in the
academic workforce across mathematical disciplines. Pursuant to a
Special Measure under Section 12 (1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010
(Vic), the School is seeking to lift the representation of women and
therefore will only consider applications from suitably qualified female
candidates for these three positions.'

For a whole range of reasons, the School is not as effective as it would
be if it had a better gender balance across its academic staff. The
usual first measures, such as requiring gender balance on appointment
committees and trying to get gender balance in shortlists haven't
worked. But the School is serious about tackling this issue, which has
led to the advertised positions.

A mailing list such as ANZstat is not the place for a detailed debate
about affirmative action, - I'd be happy to have that face-to-face if
anyone is in town - but members can be assured that these measures were
not taken lightly and were taken for the right reasons.

Best wishes,

Peter

 

Pretty sure an ad like that would be illegal in NZ. 

 

Would a transgender person be considered?  i.e. is the applicant
required to have breasts, or must the applicant not have a penis?

Damned if they do, damned if they don’t.

 

Looks like they identified an issue of inequality and are trying to
proactively remedy that.  Better than not doing anything about it.

 

Time will tell if this is an effective and/or worthwhile recruitment
strategy.  I doubt they would continue the employment of an applicant if
they simply could not the job, regardless of gender.

Affirmative action programs are meant to break down barriers, both
visible and invisible, to level the playing field, and to make sure
everyone is given an equal break.

They are not meant to guarantee equal results -- but instead proceed on
the common-sense notion that if equality of opportunity were a reality,
aboriginal people, women, people with disabilities and other groups
facing discrimination would be fairly represented in the university's
work force, which is obviously not the case.

**Why are women underrepresented in the sciences at the university
level? **

Leaving aside the fact that we live in a patriarchal society, there has
been a cultural stereotype that boys are better than girls in math.

Most people associate science and math fields with “male” and humanities
and arts fields with “female,” according to research

examined in this report. Implicit bias is common, even among individuals
who actively reject these stereotypes. This bias not only

affects individuals’ attitudes toward others but may also influence
girls’ and women’s likelihood of cultivating their own interest in math

and science. Taking the implicit bias test
at [https://implicit.harvard.edu](https://implicit.harvard.edu/) can
help people identify and understand their biases so that

they can work to compensate for them.

Not only are people more likely to associate math and science with men
than with women, people often hold negative opinions of

women in “masculine” positions, like scientists or engineers.

Research profiled in this report shows that people judge women to be
less competent than men in “male” jobs unless they are clearly

successful in their work. When a woman is clearly competent in a
“masculine” job, she is considered to be less likable. Because both

likability and competence are needed for success in the workplace, women
in science fields can find themselves in a double bind. If

women and men in science and engineering know that this bias exists,
they can work to interrupt the unconscious thought processes

that lead to it. It may also help women specifically to know that if
they encounter social disapproval in their role as a computer scientist

or physicist, it is likely not personal and there are ways to counteract
it.

**What can universities do?**

Universities can attract more female science faculty if they improve
departmental culture to promote the integration of female faculty.

Research described in this report provides evidence that women are less
satisfied with the academic workplace and more likely to

leave it earlier in their careers than their male counterparts are.
University administrators can recruit and retain more

women by implementing mentoring programs and effective work-life
policies for all faculty members.

To diversify the science fields we must take a hard look at the
stereotypes and biases that still pervade our culture. Encouraging more
girls and women to enter these vital fields will require careful
attention to the environment

in our universities and workplaces and throughout our culture.

Approaching from a statistical perspective:\
\
If I was running a sample survey, I would strive to ensure that the
design, sampling, and collection processes were appropriate to give a
representative sample of the population of interest\*. In the best of
all possible worlds, that's where it would end.\
\
But if I looked at the resulting data and found that e.g. 60% of my
respondents were male, from a population where the balance should be
approximately 50-50, then clearly my efforts have not been enough;
somewhere along the way, systematic bias has crept in, leading to
undercoverage.\
\
If I ignore that bias the resulting estimates are going to be very poor.
There's no perfect method for addressing that problem, but most
professional statisticians in that situation would attempt an
undercoverage correction of one sort or another. It wouldn't be adequate
to stand on "I did the best I could to ensure a fair sample, never mind
that I didn't get one".\
\
We have abundant evidence that academic pathways are skewed in favour of
male candidates. A quick search on "bias academia resume" will find
empirical measurements of these effects in both formal 'gatekeeper'
processes (e.g. CVs with male names likely to be rated more favourably
than identical CVs with female names) and informal processes (professors
are more likely to make time for a short-notice meeting with a
prospective grad student if the request has a "white male" name
attached). \
\
In statistical terms, we *know *our selection method has bias; do we
choose to correct for that, or not?\
\
Affirmative action is a messy solution (and if I've understood
correctly, not the first option that U. Melbourne explored) but
sometimes a messy solution is better than none.\
\
\*Simplifying here, to avoid tangents about stratified sampling and
other fancy design methods...\

I was intrigued and visited.  What a hoot. :)\
\
I decided to take the one about preference for light skinned people\
over dark skinned people.  Over 40+ pictures they train you to press as\
fast as possible a key when you see either a good word or a light\
skinned person and to press another key when you see a bad word or a\
dark skinned person.  Then they put good words and dark skinned persons\
together and bad words and light skinned people together and repeat.\
In the end they say:\
\
        Your data suggest a strong automatic preference for Light\
        Skinned People compared to Dark Skinned People.\
\
With the explanation (my emphasis added):\
\
        The interpretation is described as 'automatic preference for\
        Light Skinned People' if you responded \*faster\* when Light\
        Skinned faces and Good words were classified with the same key\
        than when Dark Skinned faces and Good words were classified\
        with the same key. Depending on the magnitude of your result,\
        your automatic preference may be described as 'slight',\
        'moderate', 'strong', or 'little to no preference'.\
\
Well, doh, you first trained my motor memory for a certain association\
and then you are surprised that I am slower (or make errors) when you\
switch?  My car has the indicator control on the right, the wipers\
on the left, and that is what I am used to.  Any idea how often I\
activate the wipers when I drive my friend's Peugot and I actually want\
to activate the indicator?  And when it eventually clicks that I have\
different controls and have to concentrate to do the right thing, how\
many (milli) seconds more it takes me to actually activate the\
indicator.  I wonder that that tells me about my biases regarding car\
manufacturers. :)\
\
Speaking of rigging a test to find the bias that you want to show.  I\
wonder whether I should spend some more time on their side and try\
some of their other "tests" to see that they are similarly rigged.\

Perhaps the proportion of women in other Australian statistics

If the department is losing talented female statistics students to other

0% maths professors in Australia are aboriginal. This is the real
problem which has to be solved.

On the other hand both problems (with aboriginal maths professors and
female maths professors) could be easily solved if Melbourne University
advertised the positions as "aboriginal female only". Opening such
"combined" positions could also be more cost effective as such opening
would not require separate positions for "female maths professors" and
for "aboriginal maths professors".

Women are over 50% of the population. If the mathematics and statistics
is not able to attract such a large group, it risks not developing its
full potential.

 

As a man, if I was a candidate for this position (I’m not) I would be
disappointed personally that I couldn’t apply. But that’s a much smaller
group than the potentially large group of females that could be
attracted to the industry. I would expect that there are still a number
of positions that suitably qualified men could apply for.

On the other hand both problems (with aboriginal maths professors and\

\
A.

But then non-aboriginal females will still be under-represented in the
population of maths professors. It is true one can optimize for
\*appearing\* to solve the underlying inequity issue in this way, but if
one is serious about making genuine progress addressing inequity issues
then it isn't the way to go.\
To see this, let's go further and add some more disadvantaged groups our
candidate must belong to: one physically-disabled, partially-sighted,
aboriginal female maths professor might "tick 4 boxes" for HR, but they
are still only one person, with one vote at faculty boards, one seat on
hiring committees, etc. So such "combined positions" really don't tackle
fundamental roots of the problem.\

How would that be "more cost effective"? It's not as if UM are creating
extra positions solely for the sake of hiring women to sit around doing
nothing; they have positions that need to be filled, and they're taking
steps to ensure that some of the people who fill those positions are
women. It doesn't change the total number of positions.\

(Style guide: in the Australian context, "Aboriginal" is capitalised for
the same reasons as "Irish", "Catholic", or "First Fleet".)\

That's an important question, as long as it's not used as a cop-out.
When an employer gets few or no applications from women (or other
underrepresented groups), there's a tendency to throw one's hands up in
the air and say "it's beyond our control, we can't hire them if they
don't apply" rather than looking a little deeper: *why *didn't they
apply, and which of those factors can we influence? The answer is rarely
as simple as just "women just don't want to do this kind of work"; from
my experience at ABS I can confirm that there are plenty of women who
are interested in maths-stats work and good at it. \

I haven’t had time to digest all of the messages over the last few days
on this discussion so apologies if these issues have been covered.

 

1.       It is useful to distinguish between “diversity” and “equity.” 
A given discipline might have an 80/20 M/F split in terms of doctorates
awarded over the last X years, suggesting that there might be “equity”
if 20% of junior academic hires over the last X years were women. 
However one would not necessarily describe that scenario as “diverse”
and “diversity” might have benefits to a school, faculty, university,
community.

2.       On the other hand, in such a scenario, it would be quite
difficult for any university, much less most/all universities, to hire
women 50% of the time without significantly lowering quality standards,
at least in terms of the indicators of quality that can be determined
prior to hiring.  Years ago in the US, and probably still today, there
was concern that about 10% of university students were African-American
but only a very small percentage of the faculty were (I don’t recall the
percentage).  There were suggestions that the faculty proportion and the
student proportion should be better balanced. It was of course pointed
out that only about 4% of PhDs awarded over the last several years were
awarded to African-Americans (if memory serves).  That itself might be
an indicator of inequity but once you’re at the stage of hiring new
faculty, how can 10% of new hires be African-American when the available
pool of recent PhDs is only 4% African-American … much less hiring an
even larger proportion to bring up the University-wide percentage to
10%?

3.       The AAUW report linked earlier is interesting.  It’s based on
the US and starts looking at STEM disciplines starting in high school. 
Some highlights …

 

Figure 3 shows “advanced placement” tests taken in STEM subjects.  AP
tests are for “advanced” high school students and, depending on
university guidelines, allow students to receive credit/pass out of
introductory university classes in these topics.  Girls are nearly half
the test-takers in Calculus AB (lowest-level), a bit behind in
chemistry, a bit ahead in environmental science and way ahead in
biology.  It’s only in the physics and computer science tests where boys
form the large majority.

 

Figure 4 then looks at the intent of first year uni students to major in
STEM fields.  So, at least among advanced high school students, girls
seemed just as interested in the STEM disciplines.  Figure 4 is all
1^st^ year students (a sample from).   Female interest outpaces male
interest in the biological/agricultural sciences.  It is about 2/3 of
the male interest for the physical and mathematical sciences … but
nobody’s interested in those so it doesn’t matter much.  Combine those
three categories and women are more likely to intend to major in those
subjects.  Males take a small lead when computer science is added.  Then
you get to engineering 14.5% of males express an intent but only 2.5% of
females.  So all told, it’s 29.3% of male students and just 15.1% of
female students but that’s almost entirely engineering.

 

Figure 6 looks at bachelor degrees awarded.  Women are 60% in bio/ag and
51% in chemistry.  Note, I believe about 60-65% of uni students in the
US are female so 51% isn’t quite parity. Women receive 45% in maths and
41% in earth/atmo/ocean sciences.  Alas it’s just 20% in physics,
engineering and comp science.  Comp science is particularly interesting
as it was at 36% in 1986, fell to 27% in 1996 and is 20% in 2006.  I
would guess there are a lot more comp sci majors these days and it might
be interesting to look at international vs. domestic students.

 

Figure 7 gives the number of bachelor degrees awarded by gender in the
STEM disciplines.  The total gap is 50,000 more towards men.  That gap
is almost entirely computer science and engineering.  That is about
78,000 for men (over half of the STEM degrees awarded to men) to about
28,000 for women (1/3 of the total).

 

Figure 9 looks at doctorates and the gaps are much larger here.  Women
are awarded about 50% of doctorates in bio/ag and 30-35% in earth, chem
and maths.  But again, the biggest gaps are engineering and comp sci.

I don’t know how well Australia mirrors the US but in the US, through
the undergraduate level, the under-representation of women in STEM is
pretty much really just under-representation in comp sci and engineering
… not maths, not bio, not chem.  It may be counter-productive to lump
all STEM disciplines together as the problem is heavily concentrated in
just those two.  There would seem to still be plenty of room for
improvement for doctorates in maths although again it would be
interesting to separate international and domestic students.

I feel that this discussion only makes sense with respect to some
"objective functions".

People who disagree with this decision seem to have in mind an objective
of universities producing the best possible research (in terms of what?
Citations? Impact?)

On the other hand, if the aim is equal opportunity, that is, for more
women to produce good research, maybe not the best possible research,
but good research nonetheless, then in my opinion this decision should
go some way in redressing a clear lack of opportunity.

I remember reading in The Economist some years ago – and can’t find the
actual article  - that in unequal societies like Turkey female pupils
are roughly equal to male pupils in language but substantially lower in
math. In Scandinavia females outperform males in languages and are equal
in math but, despite the equality, female pupils there also preferred
language related studies to math related studies.

 

I don’t know where that fits into this debate but even with equal
ability, fewer women choose STEM than men.

Are you thinking of this paper which I'm pretty sure was mentioned in
the Economist (or maybe it was the Economist Espresso) last month?
Either way it might be of interest.

Stoet G, Bailey DH, Moore AM, Geary DC (2016) Countries with Higher
Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in
Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation
for Girls. PLoS ONE 11(4): e0153857. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153857

Abstract:

Despite international advancements in gender equality across a variety
of societal domains, the underrepresentation of girls and women in
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related fields
persists. In this study, we explored the possibility that the sex
difference in mathematics anxiety contributes to this disparity. More
specifically, we tested a number of predictions from the prominent
gender stratification model, which is the leading psychological theory
of cross-national patterns of sex differences in mathematics anxiety and
performance. To this end, we analyzed data from 761,655 15-year old
students across 68 nations who participated in the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA). Most importantly and contra
predictions, we showed that economically developed and more gender equal
countries have a lower overall level of mathematics anxiety, and yet a
larger national sex difference in mathematics anxiety relative to less
developed countries. Further, although relatively more mothers work in
STEM fields in more developed countries, these parents valued, on
average, mathematical competence more in their sons than their
daughters. The proportion of mothers working in STEM was unrelated to
sex differences in mathematics anxiety or performance. We propose that
the gender stratification model fails to account for these national
patterns and that an alternative model is needed. In the discussion, we
suggest how an interaction between socio-cultural values and
sex-specific psychological traits can better explain these patterns. We
also discuss implications for policies aiming to increase girls’ STEM
participation.

cheers,

Cam.

Being the top University, UniMelb just happened to get in the focus for
this issue, but there are interesting things happening in "less
prominent" Universities, mostly behind the scene. Here is the clause to
the essential SELECTION CRITERIA for the position recently advertised by
University of South Australia (the "add" is attached):

Eligibility of appointment is restricted to persons who:

• Have had casual academic employment experience within the past twelve
(12) months plus no continuing employment within UniSA during the
previous three (3) years; or

• Have other relevant work experience for the work activity to be
undertaken; or

• Are enrolled as a student and the work required is generally related
to the degree course being undertaken.\] 

Why not to name this specific person when "advertised"? I think we
should accept that equal opportunities (and often fairness, in general)
is quite a flexible concept some universities and the Union can adjust
to fit their business.

Maybe this is legal according to the equivalent of South Australian
Equal Opportunity Act, I am not a layer - just found this point
corresponding to the discussion.

Kind regards

Max Moldovan

I think Walters point of there being a difference between “diversity”
and “equity” is a good one.

 

Of course we want equity, if 30% of a group graduates with a PhD and
want work then we want systems in place to ensure 30% find work.

 

But do we actually want to ensure that each and every group represents
50%? Doesn’t really make sense does it? Some groups might be drawn to
certain disciplines more than others and what’s wrong with that? Maybe
just as long as we ensure that all people get equal treatment and
opportunity, especially if they happen to be a minority in that
discipline, then one could infer the diversity, whatever it is, is
acceptable?

 

So the interesting question then becomes “how exactly does one measure
if a minority is getting equal treatment and opportunity”?? And that
brings us back to ensuring equity?

Hello all\
\
Can I make some comments from a non-academic but professional
perspective:

-   Australia has a significant problem in the numbers of mathematical
    sciences graduates that we are producing.  Compared with countries
    such as the UK, New Zealand, Canada and the US which have not too
    dissimilar educational and university systems, we produce less than
    half as many per capita.  As an employer of statisticians I see this
    on a regular basis and as an observer of our community I see it. 

-   The poor funding of many mathematical departments in our
    universities is in part because they have less students. Hence there
    is both self-interest and community interest in improving
    this situation.

-   We, the mathematical sciences community must try to do something
    about this.  Indeed, it is a central part of the recently released
    Decadal Plan.  It is not enough to highlight the problem and say
    that *someone *should fix it, *we *should work to fix it.

-   It is difficult to ignore the fact that for one significant sector
    of our community - women - the mathematical sciences are not
    performing well.  If we raised the participation of women in the
    mathematical sciences to that of men our problems would be well on
    the way to being addressed.  There are likely to be other groups as
    well, but this one stands out and it is large.

-   Academics are appointed with a purpose and that is to serve the
    university and their discipline.  I don't believe that contribution
    is simply measured by research - the academics role is multifaceted
    with teaching, scholarship, leadership, mentoring and being an
    example also being important.

-   The deficiency of women role models in mathematical science
    departments is understandably an issue in recruiting women students
    to our areas.   The problem is not as bad as it used to be, but I
    can understand that it needs to be addressed and it is arguable that
    every year it is delayed is unfair to the students who might
    otherwise be exposed to these role models.

-   Hence I can understand the reasons behind the University of
    Melbourne decision, and knowing at least some of the individuals
    involved, I believe that it would not have been a decision lightly
    made.  I personally feel that it should be given our support as a
    pragmatic step towards a goal that we should all have.

-   It is not the only step that needs to be taken to achieve both
    equity and greater participation in the mathematical sciences.  We
    need to be doing much more to get the message out that mathematics
    is worth doing. 

-   That will create more jobs for mathematics as well, I believe in
    greater numbers than these three positions in Melbourne.  While I
    can sympathise with those who feel excluded from applying for the
    Melbourne jobs, the decision makers have to look at the bigger
    picture and the decision is in some ways not different from those
    decising which disciplines to offer them in.

Finally, this discussionhas become somewhat emotive.  Can I suggest that
we all calm down and respect the good intentions of all involved. 

Regards\
John Henstridge

Thanks John for you well reasoned analysis 

From my own experience I know that having women on staff helps attract
and retain female Maths students and show them that maths is a viable
career. If to get these role models there need to be targeted
appointments then so be it\

What kind of role model is she going to be by obtaining her position
such "unusual" way? Is it a position of a professor of maths or a
professor of politics?
